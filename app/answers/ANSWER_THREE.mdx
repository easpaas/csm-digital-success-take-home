Hi Alex,
<br/>
I hope you’re doing well! I’ve been monitoring your companys account closely and noticed a significant reduction in your build frequency and usage quarter over quarter. I wanted to reach out proactively to understand more about this shift and discuss any challenges or opportunities that may have led to these changes.

Since your marketing pages are hosted on Vercel, I want to ensure that you’re getting the most value from the platform. I also saw that Tanner, your project champion, has moved on. I’d love to connect and make sure we’re aligned on your current priorities, and help drive success moving forward.

Given your team's structure and the integration of Cloudflare as a reverse proxy, I would be happy to help troubleshoot any errors you’ve encountered in recent builds, and see if there are optimizations or new solutions we can explore to reduce errors and improve the overall experience. Additionally, I’d be glad to perform a quick discovery session to dive into any other areas of concern or goals you might have, ensuring you're continuing to make the most of your Vercel subscription.

Could we set up a call or meeting at your convenience to discuss this further? I’d be happy to walk through any questions you might have and work with you to identify any areas where Vercel can deliver more value for your marketing team.

<br/>
Looking forward to hearing from you!
