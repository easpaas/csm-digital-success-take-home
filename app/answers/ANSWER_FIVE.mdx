Thank you for reaching out, Travis!

I hope you’re doing well! I noticed that your upcoming billing period on Vercel shows a significant increase in usage, with your monthly spend rising to $2,100 from the typical $900. This appears to be largely due to increased data transfer costs. Given that this is a considerable jump, I wanted to reach out proactively to ensure that you're aware of this change and to explore any potential opportunities for optimization.
<br/>

Additionally, I noticed that your website is experiencing poor Core Web Vitals performance, specifically with the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score. This can have a direct impact on user experience and SEO, so it’s important we address this quickly.
<br/>

Would you be open to schedule some time to review your usage and Core Web Vitals together. We can look into ways to reduce data transfer costs, improve performance, and ensure your site is optimized for both users and search engines. I’m confident that we can find a solution that keeps your costs in check while improving overall performance.

Please let me know a convenient time for you, or if there’s any additional information you’d like to share ahead of our discussion. I’m here to help however I can.
