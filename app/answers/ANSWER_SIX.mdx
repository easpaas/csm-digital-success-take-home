**Why didn’t my MIUs cover this bill?**
<br/>

MIUs are monthly entitlements designed to cover a portion of your usage, including things like function duration and data transfer. However, they do not roll over to the next month if unused. This is why any unused MIUs from last month couldn’t be applied to your current billing cycle.
<br/>


**To prevent unexpected overage costs, here are some recommendations:**

<br/>
*Optimize Fast Data Transfer:* Use caching strategies effectively. By ensuring more data is cached closer to users, you can significantly reduce fast origin transfer and data transfer costs.
<br/>

*Function Optimization:* Review your serverless functions to minimize their duration and execution. For example, reducing dependencies, optimizing code, or using edge functions for lighter workloads can help.
<br/>

*Monitoring and Alerts:* Set up usage monitoring and alerts through Vercel’s dashboard to track and forecast usage trends, enabling proactive adjustments.
<br/>

*Right-Sizing MIUs:* Consider adjusting your MIU allocation if your usage patterns consistently exceed your current entitlement. This can provide a cost-effective way to handle higher workloads.
